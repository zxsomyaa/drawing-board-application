# Drawing Board Application

An interactive web-based drawing application built using **p5.js** that allows users to create digital artwork using multiple drawing tools. The application focuses on real-time rendering, intuitive user interaction, and modular graphics programming concepts.

This project was developed as part of a graphics programming coursework and demonstrates practical implementation of canvas-based drawing tools using JavaScript.
